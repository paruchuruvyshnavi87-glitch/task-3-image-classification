📌 Task-3: Image Classification using CNN
📖 Description

This project implements an Image Classification model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
The model is built using TensorFlow (Keras) and trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset to classify images into different categories.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow & Keras

NumPy

Matplotlib

Google Colab (Jupyter Notebook)

📂 Dataset

CIFAR-10 Dataset

Contains 60,000 color images (32×32 pixels)

10 different classes

Dataset loaded directly using TensorFlow

⚙️ Implementation Steps

Imported required libraries

Loaded and normalized the CIFAR-10 dataset

Built a CNN model using convolution, pooling, and dense layers

Compiled the model using Adam optimizer and categorical loss

Trained the model for multiple epochs

Evaluated the model performance on the test dataset
